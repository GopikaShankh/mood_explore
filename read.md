# Mood Tracking Application

This project is a mood tracking application built with a React frontend and an Express/MongoDB backend. The application allows users to submit their moods, view a history of their moods, and receive suggestions based on their mood messages. Here are the key components and their functionalities:

## Frontend (React)
- **HomePage**: The landing page with a brief description and a login button.
- **Login**: A form for users to create an account.
- **Dashboard**: Allows users to submit their mood and view the latest mood.
- **History**: Displays a list of all submitted moods.
- **MoodForm**: A form component for submitting a new mood.
- **MoodList**: Displays a list of moods with options to delete them.
- **Navbar**: A navigation bar with links to Home and History.

## Backend (Express/MongoDB)
- **Models**: Defines the Mood schema for storing mood data in MongoDB.
- **Routes**: Handles API endpoints for creating, retrieving, and deleting moods.
- **Gemini API**: Integrates with Google's Generative AI to analyze mood messages and provide suggestions.

## Best Use Case
The best use case for this application is for individuals or mental health professionals who want to track and analyze mood patterns over time. Users can:

- **Submit Moods**: Users can submit their current mood and a message describing how they feel.
- **Receive Suggestions**: The application uses AI to analyze the mood message and provide suggestions for improving mood.
- **View Mood History**: Users can view a history of their submitted moods, which can help identify patterns and triggers.
- **Delete Moods**: Users can delete moods from their history if needed.

This application can be particularly useful for:
- **Personal Use**: Individuals who want to keep track of their emotional well-being.
- **Therapists**: Mental health professionals who want to monitor their clients' moods and provide personalized advice.
- **Research**: Researchers studying mood patterns and the effectiveness of different interventions.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Frontend**: Navigate to the `client` directory and run `npm start` to start the React application.
2. **Backend**: Navigate to the `server` directory and run `npm run dev` to start the Express server with nodemon.

## Example Workflow
1. User visits the homepage and navigates to the login page.
2. User creates an account and is redirected to the dashboard.
3. User submits their mood and receives suggestions.
4. User can view their mood history and delete any mood entries if needed.

This project provides a comprehensive solution for mood tracking and analysis, leveraging modern web technologies and AI.
